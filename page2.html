        Nadia Padovani said: "It’s not easy being a woman in a predominantly male world. It’s very important to be credible in the eyes of others,
        and that’s what makes being the first woman to lead a MotoGP team a daily challenge." 
        So girls believe in yourselves it may be a hard journey, but who doesnt love to see a mans face when you succeed.
